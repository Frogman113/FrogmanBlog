## About MDX

MDX is an extension of Markdown with the ability to import `.astro`,
`.jsx`, `.tsx` and other framework components you have integrated.

This guide covers the basics of MDX syntax and how to use it, as well as a few examples.

## Importing shared components

Importing a component from the `/components` directory.

This component accepts a Javascript date object and format it as a string.

```jsx
import FormattedDate from "@components/FormattedDate.astro";

<FormattedDate date={new Date()} />
```

import FormattedDate from "@components/FormattedDate.astro";

<FormattedDate date={new Date()} />

---

## Importing private components

Importing a component from a relative path to your content.

This component displays an alert when the button is clicked.

```jsx
import RelativeComponent from "./component.astro";

<RelativeComponent />
```

import RelativeComponent from "./component.astro";

<RelativeComponent />

## Using frameworks

By default Micro has zero frameworks installed. If you install a framework, components of that framework can be used in MDX files.

<Callout>
  Don't forget to use [client
  directives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives)
  to make framework components interactive.
</Callout>

```astro
<ReactComponent client:load />
```

## Markdown syntax guide

MDX supports Markdown syntax, so you can use all the features of Markdown in your MDX files.

More about Markdown syntax in this [blog post](markdown-syntax-guide).
