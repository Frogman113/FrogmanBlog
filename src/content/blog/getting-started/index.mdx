## Get Astro Milidev

Clone the [Astro Milidev repository](https://github.com/bartoszlenar/astro-milidev.git).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bartoszlenar/astro-milidev.git my-astro-milidev
```

```sh
cd my-astro-micro
```

```sh
npm i
```

```sh
npm run build
```

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Customize the website metadata

To change the website metadata, edit `src/consts.ts`.

This file contains also the type definitions. Please check them to be sure which value is required.

### Image paths

All image paths are relative to the `public` directory.

It's essential that you start the path with `/`. Otherwise, you might encounter issues, especially when hosting your site with `base` path ("in the subdirectory").

### Global metadata

Start with `GLOBAL` variable:

```ts
// src/consts.ts

export const GLOBAL: GlobalSite = {
  title: "Astro Milidev",
  description: "a minimalistic blog+portfolio Astro theme",
  author: "John Doe",
  authorPhotoSrc: "/johndoe.png",
  logo: {
    darkThemeSrc: "/logo/logo_dark.png",
    lightThemeSrc: "/logo/logo_light.png",
  }
};
```

- `title` and `description` - part of the metadata (head, title, etc.) and RSS.
- `author` - part of the metadata, footer and home site.
- `authorPhotoSrc` - rendered on the home site and the bio under the blog posts.
- `logo` - optional, but if present, you must provide light and dark versions. Rendered in the header. If not present, `title` text will be rendered instead.

---

### Home site

```ts
// src/consts.ts

export const HOME: HomeSite = {
  title: "Home title",
  blogEntries: 5,
  projectEntries: 3,
  talkEntries: 3,
};
```

- `title` - optional, appended to the website title.
- `blogEntries`, `projectEntries`, `talkEntries` - how many entries from the particular collections are displayed on the home site.

---

### Collections site

By default, there are three collections in Astro Milidev: blog, projects, and talks.

```ts
export const BLOG: BlogSite = {
  title: "Blog",
  pageSize: 10,
  license: {
    name: "CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",
    href: "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0",
  },
};

export const PROJECTS: CollectionSite = {
  title: "Projects",
  pageSize: 10,
};

export const TALKS: CollectionSite = {
  title: "Talks",
  pageSize: 10,
};
```

- `title` - optional, appended to the website title.
- `pageSize` - how many entries are displayed on the single page on the collection site.
- `license` - license information, added to all blog post sites.

---

## Add your contact details

```ts
// src/consts.ts

export const CONTACT: ContactSite = [
  {
    type: "Email",
    href: "mailto:email@example.com",
    account: "email@example.com",
  },
  {
    type: "X",
    href: "https://x.com/BillGates",
    account: "@BillGates",
  },
  {
    type: "GitHub",
    href: "https://github.com/dotnet",
    account: "dotnet",
  },
  {
    type: "LinkedIn",
    href: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamhgates/",
  },
];
```

All above are displayed on the contact site. 

- `type` and `href` - the type of the contact and the link that navigates to it.
- `account` - optional, displayed on the contact site.


## Deploy the site

To set up RSS and Giscus, it's easier if the site is deployed and has a URL for you to use. Instantly deploy to Vercel or Netlify by clicking the buttons below.

<div class="flex gap-2">
  <a target="_blank" aria-label="Deploy with Vercel" href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro">
    <img src="deploy_vercel.svg" />
  </a>
  <a target="_blank" aria-label="Deploy with Netlify" href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/trevortylerlee/astro-micro">
    <img src="deploy_netlify.svg" />
  </a>
</div>

To deploy manually see [Astro's docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/).

## Set up the address

Navigate to the `astro.config.mjs` file and set the `site` and `base` properties.

- `site` - the URL of your site, starting with protocol
- `base` - the base path of your site, if it's hosted in a subdirectory. It should start and end with a slash.

```js
// astro.config.mjs

export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://bartoszlenar.github.io",
  base: "/astro-milidev/",
  integrations: [tailwind(), sitemap(), mdx(), pagefind()],
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      theme: "css-variables",
    },
  },
});
```

## Set up Giscus

Follow the steps at [giscus.app](https://giscus.app). Once you get your custom Giscus script from that site, go to `Giscus.astro` and replace that script with your own.

```js
// src/components/Giscus.astro

<script
  is:inline
  src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
  data-repo="trevortylerlee/astro-micro"
  data-repo-id="R_kgDOL_6l9Q"
  data-category="Announcements"
  data-category-id="DIC_kwDOL_6l9c4Cfk55"
  data-mapping="pathname"
  data-strict="0"
  data-reactions-enabled="1"
  data-emit-metadata="0"
  data-input-position="top"
  data-theme="preferred_color_scheme"
  data-lang="en"
  data-loading="lazy"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  async></script>

```

To change the Giscus themes used, edit the `setGiscusTheme` function in `Head.astro`.
