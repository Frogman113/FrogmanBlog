    Essentially, it's the <Link href="https://astro-micro.vercel.app/"
      >Astro Micro</Link
    > theme by
    <Link href="https://github.com/trevortylerlee">Trevor Lee</Link>, but with a
    few tweaks here and there.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's a base theme for my own blog that I released as a standalone Astro
    theme just to prove that even a backend engineer like myself can jump in the
    frontend world if needed and deliver a lot of value within a single day of
    work.
